# Java-Module-4-LinkedList-Cannons

Part 1
Write a Cannon class with a private boolean loaded field and a fire()
method that checks if the bullet is in the cannon before firing.
If the cannon is not loaded, it will display (System.out.println) 
that there is no ball in the cannon,
and then the ball will be loaded into that cannon.

Part 2
In the main method of the Program class, 
create a LinkedList collection to hold the cannons.
Add some Cannons to the collection, 
then use a for loop to load all the cannons.
